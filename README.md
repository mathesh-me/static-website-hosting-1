#  Terraform AWS S3 Static Website Hosting

## Project Description:
In this project, I developed a streamlined infrastructure for hosting a static website using Terraform and Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the automated provisioning and deployment of a web hosting solution for static websites.

## Key Components and Features:

### Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
I utilized Terraform, an IaC tool, to define and provision the AWS resources required for our static website hosting solution. This allows for version-controlled, repeatable infrastructure deployments.

### AWS S3 Bucket:
I created an S3 bucket to store and serve the static website files. This bucket is configured for website hosting, allowing for easy content delivery.

### Content Upload and Management: 
I provided instructions and scripts for uploading and managing your website content within the S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites:

1. Basic knowledge of AWS services and concepts.
2. Familiarity with Terraform and infrastructure as code principles.
3. An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
4. This project serves as an excellent foundation for hosting various types of static websites, including personal blogs, portfolio sites, or small business websites.
